# Pacman

This is a simple Pacman clone, created with Typescript/Javascript, HTML5 canvas and CSS.
In future I plan to code this game again but in C++, using SMFL, and with a better AI.

# What I learned

- Applied some of the basics SOLID principles
- Improved my knowledge about OOP programming
- Learned about HTML canvas and basics animations
- I use this project to practice and learn some Typescript
